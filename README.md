# Missile Defense Command
Welcome to one of my COMP 3609 Game Programming projects! This game was designed using the teachings of the COMP 3609 gaming programming course as well as in conjunction with the Java 2D API. The story follows a city that is under attack following the start of World War V. As the protagonist, you operate a laser cannon in defense of the city and must use it to destroy as many missiles as possible before they impact the city.
